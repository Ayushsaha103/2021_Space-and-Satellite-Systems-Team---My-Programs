### calc_sun_pos and calc_moon_pos
Calculate the position of the sun and moon (in global reference frame), based on various parametric inputs to satellite

### sun_sensors_project
Calculate position of the sun, based on brightness readings from the 24 light sensors on the cubesat
'low_pass_filter.py' contains the logic for cleaning the input data
'sun_sensors_data.csv' contains real data values read from a test experiment with the cubesat

### sun_position_simulation_software
Contains the logic for a newer, more accurate sun position sensor algorithm
Idea: better detection of outlier sensor readings
