# This software simulates a changing sun position vector
# Outliers are thrown in and detected by algorithm, accuracy > 95%
# Program-crash-detection-and-response algorithm equipped

# Sun position vector function is modifiable (w/ respect to t)
    # NOTE: If you want to modify this, you have to make it include both positive and neg. z values
    # You also must be careful and test any changes
# Decceleration and acceleration rate is included and modifiable
# Angular momentum is included and modifiable
# Discrete time stamps are modifiable
# Duration interval of constant velocity (before decceleration begins) is modifiable
# speed of program running is modifiable (via time_change_rate)

# program is currently set so that usual deg. change per time interval (0.1 sec)
# is about 0.5-5 degs
